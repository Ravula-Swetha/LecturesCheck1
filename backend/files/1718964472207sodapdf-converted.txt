Redefine you and you can see the time move just like tears in the  
eyes do and when you’re feeling oh, baby, I’ll be right here between seeing silence so  
breathe easy, my dear you can find sunshine in the rain I will come running when you call my name even 
a broken heart  
can be again forget about the one who cause you  
pain I swear love you in a different way.
